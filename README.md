# QSVM
This repository contains an implementation of a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVm) using the Qiskit framework. The QSVm is a quantum machine learning algorithm that can be used for binary classification problems. It has the potential to provide speedups over classical SVM algorithms on certain types of problems.

# PREQUISITES
## python
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed:<br />
	2.Qiskit <br />
	3.NumPy <br />
	4.Matplotlib <br />
## Q#
 To use the Q# implementation of the QSVm, you will need to have the following software and hardware prerequisites:

### Software Prerequisites
**[Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/overview-what-is-qsharp-and-qdk#get-started-with-q-and-the-quantum-development-kit)**. <br />
Q# is part of the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, so you will need to install the QDK to use Q#. 
<br />
**[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
 The Q# implementation of the QSVm relies on Python for data processing and visualization, so you will  need to have Python 3.x installed.

### Hardware Prerequisites
The QSVm is a quantum algorithm and requires access to a quantum computer or simulator to run. You have the following options:

**Use a quantum simulator:** <br />

The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit includes a simulator that you can use to run Q# programs on your local machine.

**Access a quantum computer via the cloud:** <br />

Microsoft Azure provides access to a quantum computer via the Azure Quantum service. You can use the Q# implementation of the QSVm to submit jobs to the Azure Quantum service. <br />
Once you have satisfied these prerequisites, you can start using the Q# implementation of the QSVm.
