# QSVM
This repository contains an implementation of a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVm) using the Qiskit framework. The QSVm is a quantum machine learning algorithm that can be used for binary classification problems. It has the potential to provide speedups over classical SVM algorithms on certain types of problems.

## PREQUISITES
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed:<br />
	1.Python 3.x <br />
	2.Qiskit <br />
	3.NumPy <br />
	4.Matplotlib <br />
