# QSVM
This repository contains an implementation of a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVm) using the Qiskit framework. The QSVm is a quantum machine learning algorithm that can be used for binary classification problems. It has the potential to provide speedups over classical SVM algorithms on certain types of problems.

## PREQUISITES
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed:
	1.Python 3.x
	2.Qiskit
	3.NumPy
	4.Matplotlib
